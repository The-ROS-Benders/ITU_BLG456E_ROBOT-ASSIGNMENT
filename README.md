# ITU_BLG456E_ROBOT-ASSIGNMENT

Guide Robot Implemented on ROS

Design of the solution as it is taken from the report section 4:

   There will be a robot that will wait for a ‘Hello!’ voice input from the user to start
running the guidance program. After the robot starts running, it will ask for the digits of
the room number where the user wants to go. After taking four digits, it will require an
approval from the user whether the room number taken as an input is correct. If the
inputs were wrong, it will ask for them again. Otherwise, it will start to drive the target
classroom after telling user, ‘ I am going to an adventure Hoooooooray! ’. When the target
classroom is reached, the robot will stop near to the door of the classroom and its task is
finished. In conclusion, user will be guided to his/her target classroom with the aid of a
robot.
